# Global Freedom Analysis considering the Economic and Personal Freedom Factors

* Analyzed global freedom using the CATO Institute's annual Human Freedom Index (HFI) report, focusing on economic and personal freedom.
* Executed comprehensive data preparation: removed irrelevant columns, standardized data formats, and imputed missing values with mean values for normally distributed data, ensuring data integrity and analytical accuracy.
* Enhanced dataset structure by correcting the index, paving the way for precise analysis.
* Transformed complex raw data into an interactive, user-friendly dashboard, enabling dynamic exploration of global freedom trends and facilitating insightful analysis for researchers and policymakers.

This project not only provided a deep dive into the state of global freedom but also showcased the power of effective data visualization and preparation in making complex data accessible and engaging.
